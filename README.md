### Working on this project,
I started off with setting up layout using flex box. I had difficulty making things stay where I wanted, and things overlapped on top of each other as I adjust screen size. I used table to make a game board, and started working on game logics. Most difficult and time consuming part of this was making clicks put X and O alternatively. After that, I was having problem patching data to API, but I was able to solve this problem with help of a colleague.

### From here on,
I will be working on this project continuously as I learn more throughout the curriculum at GA. As of right now, I am working on adding easy mode AI, and I was able to make computer place O inside empty box after user clicks a box to place X, and pass in correct values to the stored array received from API but I'm having trouble with patching the computer's move. I also need to figure out how to make the code work only when user clicks a button to play this mode.
