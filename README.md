### Working on this first project

It was great opportunity to get used to coding and JavaScript. I had lots of fun digging through online resources and working with colleagues to come up with a solution when I'm stuck. I learned simple data structure of a single page application running on JavaScript, and how to interact with a RESTful API using Ajax. Writing simple game logic was also very fun too. It was very interesting to see how other people came up with different solutions for the it.
